Hello, my name is "mohd abdul khader" and I live in "india", the country in development. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course "front end development by meta" because I do not have any special source of income and I don't earn enough money and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in "informatin technology" , and i searching for a job from a long time for earning money for taking this course, and i not find yet, and the time goes on, and receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies and by taking it to allow to take off a paid internship and can take another course in machine learning path . I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my career and not the money. Hopefully this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and new technologies, I'm eager to work and to advance in my career.
